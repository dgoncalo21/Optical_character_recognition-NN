# Optical_character_recognition-NN
Creation of neural network classifiers for the identification of handwritten numbers.

Project developed for the course "Neural computation and fuzzy systems". Two neural network models were developed: associative memory plus the classifier and one with the classifier only.
The model with more consistent results was the first with an overall accuracy of 88%.
